### Hi there, I am glad you are visiting my profile ðŸ‘‹

I am a creative and ambitious 25 years old data and AI enthusiast. Currently, I am in my last year as a Mathematical Engineering master's student at Politecnico di Milano. 

My engineering background has certainly served me well in learning technical skills in advanced mathematics, statistics, AI, and coding (R, Python, SQL), as well as in cultivating abilities such as problem-solving, organization, and analytical reasoning.

In particular, during my studies, I became really fascinated by the potential of Deep Learning and hence I am eager to deepen my knowledge in this field. 
Among the extraordinary variety of fields in which the application of analytics and AI can be a revolutionary tool, I am extremely interested in applications in the biomedical sector (e.g.,  personalized medicine), professional sports (e.g., performance analysis, scouting), and social media analysis. 

At the moment I am looking for an internship in an innovative and stimulating environment where to develop my thesis and kickstart my career.

In my free time, I am a serial BBQer and pizza maker. I love (almost) every sport and I am a nerd about statistics of teams and players.
